# Mission API/Data Sync

As of version 1.4.0, OpenTAKServer supports the Mission API which enables support for plugins such as Data Sync and Fire Area Survey. This
API only works when the EUD is connected to the server via SSL. Support for the Mission API is in the early stages so
there may still be bugs. If you encounter any problems, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAKServer/issues).
